The Chord Progression Generator is a Python tool that creates 8-bar chord progressions based on user moods, matching scales and chords to emotions. Options include arpeggiated chords, passing tones, and random sequences. With a vast chord library, it saves progressions as MIDI files, ideal for musicians seeking inspiration.
